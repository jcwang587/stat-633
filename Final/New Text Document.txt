I initialized the group contact and choose the EV topic for the group. Kuanjung and I retrieve the dataset for analysis. I did the analysis for fuel price and tax. Ping did the analysis for vehicles manufacture and models. Kuanjung made the shiny app for income analysis. We made the slides for our own part of analysis and I made the background and summary slides and others helped to revision.
