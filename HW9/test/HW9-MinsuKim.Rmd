## Data
```{r}
data <- read.csv("01_data_cleaning/shinkansen_stations_geocoded.csv")
```

## Analysis of operating companies

Count the number of Shinkansen_Line operated by each company.
Note: There are 7 intersection stations, and we count the number of Shinkansen_Line twice for the intersection stations. 
For this, we split the string in the `Shinkansen_Line` column when it has both Shinkansen line names and unnest the data.

```{r}
dat <- data %>%
  mutate(Line_name = strsplit(Shinkansen_Line, ",")) %>%
  tidyr::unnest(Line_name) %>%
  select(-Shinkansen_Line) %>%
  rename(Shinkansen_Line = Line_name)
dat$Shinkansen_Line <- gsub("-", "_", dat$Shinkansen_Line)
dat$Shinkansen_Line <- gsub("Shinknsen", "Shinkansen", dat$Shinkansen_Line)
```

```{r}
cnt_by_company <- dat %>%
  count(Company, Shinkansen_Line) %>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  mutate(total_n = sum(n)) %>%
  ungroup()

annotations <- list()
for (i in 1:length(unique(cnt_by_company$Company))) {
  annotations[[i]] <- list(
    x = unique(cnt_by_company$Company)[[i]],
    y = unique(cnt_by_company$total_n)[[i]],
    text = unique(cnt_by_company$total_n)[[i]],
    yanchor = "bottom",
    showarrow = FALSE
  )
}

cnt_by_company %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~Company,
    y = ~n,
    color = ~Shinkansen_Line,
    colors = "Spectral",
    hoverinfo = "text",
    text = ~ paste(n, "stations in", Shinkansen_Line)
  ) %>%
  add_bars() %>%
  layout(
    barmode = "stack",
    xaxis = list(title = "Company"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Number of Shinkansen Line"),
    title = "Number of Shinkansen Line by Company",
    annotations = annotations
